## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading to 0.9.8

No breaking changes. All changes are backward compatible:
- **bd daemon**: New optional background service for auto-sync workflows
- **bd sync**: New optional git integration command
- **bd compact**: New optional command for issue summarization (requires Anthropic API key)
- **--format flag**: Optional new feature for `bd list`

Simply pull the latest version and rebuild:
```bash
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
# or
git pull && go build -o bd ./cmd/bd
```

**Note**: The `bd compact` command requires an Anthropic API key in `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. All other features work without any additional setup.

### Upgrading to 0.9.2

No breaking changes. All changes are backward compatible:
- **--deps flag**: Optional new feature for `bd create`
- **external_ref**: Optional field, existing issues unaffected
- **Metadata table**: Auto-migrates on first use
- **Bug fixes**: All critical fixes are transparent to users

Simply pull the latest version and rebuild:
```bash
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
# or
git pull && go build -o bd ./cmd/bd
```

### Upgrading to 0.9.1

No breaking changes. All changes are backward compatible:
- **Auto-migration**: The dirty_issues table is automatically added to existing databases
- **Auto-flush/import**: Enabled by default, improves workflow (can disable with flags if needed)
- **ID partitioning**: Optional feature, use `--id` flag only if needed for parallel workers

If you're upgrading from 0.9.0, simply pull the latest version. Your existing database will be automatically migrated on first use.

### Upgrading to 0.9.0

No breaking changes. The JSONL export format is backward compatible.

If you have issues in your database:
1. Run `bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl` to create the text file
2. Commit `.beads/issues.jsonl` to git
3. Add `.beads/*.db` to `.gitignore`

New collaborators can clone the repo and run:
```bash
bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl
```

The SQLite database will be automatically populated from the JSONL file.
